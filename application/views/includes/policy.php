    <li>AFFILIATES CODE OF ETHICS
    <ol>
    <li>In pursuing the success of their SOUKTRAIN business, SOUKTRAIN independent affiliates shall safeguard
                     and protect the reputation of SOUKTRAIN and its products and services. Affiliates 
                    shall refrain from all conduct which might be harmful to the reputation of SOUKTRAIN 
                    and its products and services or will damage the ability of others to participate in 
                    the SOUKTRAIN business opportunity. SOUKTRAIN affiliates will be professional in the 
                    approach to their business, and will treat other affiliates, customers, clients and
                     SOUKTRAIN employees respectfully and courteously in their interaction. Affiliates will 
                    strictly avoid all deceptive, misleading, discourteous, unethical, and immoral conducts.
                     SOUKTRAIN affiliates will respect the honest efforts of fellow affiliates and will not 
                    engage in predatory or unethical recruitment practices.

                     unfairly representing any competing opportunity. SOUKTRAIN 
                    believes that the ultimate success of all SOUKTRAIN affiliates depends
