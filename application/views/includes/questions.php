                         <dt>2.	How do I receive my coaching/ mentoring lessons?</dt>
                        <dd>Immediately your account is activated the first month training 
                            module is sent to your study archive ready for you to download. 
                            Your lecture theatre is your virtual classroom. Here you partake
                             in class activities, asking and answering questions. 
                             This is an interactive programme where a lot of learning, 
                            practice and real life demonstrations take place. Equally, 
                            you are strongly advised to register and belong to an Affiliate 
                            Service Provision Centre (ASPC) nearest to you. This is where our 
                            once-in-a-month offline coaching and mentoring takes place. 
                        </dd>
                         <dt>3.	What, if there is no ASPC (Affiliate Service Provision Centre) near me?</dt>
                        <dd>You can become one. For conditions and requirements contact the Admin</dd>
                         <dt>4.	Can I be a student/ mentee and at the same time an affiliate? </dt>
                        <dd>Yes! As a matter of fact, you cannot be an affiliate if you are not our 
                            mentee first of all. But you can be our mentee without being an affiliate.
                             To be an affiliate means, apart from being coached and mentored by us, you
                             have also agreed to be sharing the good news about our products and services
                             with your friends and loved ones and bring them too into the programme. 
                            As a result, you get all the benefits that are attached to doing so. Whereas,
                             as a mentee, you only enjoy our coaching and mentoring services alone for 
                            a period of 1 year. 
                        </dd> 
                        <dt>5.	Do I have to pay additional money aside of
                             the annual coaching fee of N18, 000 to become an affiliate?</dt>
                        <dd>No! You don’t pay any additional money. Your non-refundable-annual
                             coaching fee of N18, 000 qualifies you to be an affiliate if you so choose.
                            Your choosing to join the affiliate programme even gives you an unfair advantage 
                            – it makes you remain a life-time student/ mentee with SOUKTRAIN for just that N18, 000 which
                            you’ve paid.  But make sure you check in, ‘I want to be an affiliate’ box 	      
                             before you submit your form, otherwise you will be taken in for coaching/ mentoring programme 
                            only. Once you submit the form, it is final; your decisions are not reversible.

                        <dt>6.	As an affiliate, how do I monitor and manage my business and how do I get paid?</dt>
                        <dd>In your back office, you have different accounts, departments and
                             tools to monitor and manage your business. Your commissions, bonuses,
                             etc. are put in their respective accounts in your office. You are the one
                             to transfer money from your e-wallet to your local bank account. You can do 
                            that as many times as possible within the week. It takes 72 working hours for 
                            the money to be deposited in your local bank account each time you transfer.

                         <dt>8.	As a non affiliate member, can I introduce others to the programme?</dt>
                        <dd>Sure, you can! But, you will not be rewarded by cash.

                            Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship.
